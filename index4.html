 <p align="justify" style="background-color: red ;"> <b> Ubuntu 20.04 LTS is the latest long term support version of Ubuntu. It is possible to install and use a simple Active Directory on top of Ubuntu, based on the open source <i> SAMBA </i> 4 <u> software</u>. </b> I have checked this with Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04 LTS and it works. The Acttive Directory works at the Server 2008 R2 functional level. We can maintain the AD using RSAT (Remote Administration Tools) from Windows 10. It is also possible to use roaming user profiles and home folders, more about this in a later post. </p>

  <p align="justify" style="font-size: 30px; color: blueviolet;">  Are you interested to try this out on your own server? Active Directory is used in corporations for centralized authentication and management of users, groups and computers. <br> So, it is recommended to host the server at your own premises. <br>I have not added a second domain controller to active directory; you are free to try that out.
